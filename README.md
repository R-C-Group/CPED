## <a name="#Introduction">Introduction</a>
We construct a dataset named **CPED** from 40 Chinese TV shows. CPED consists of multisource knowledge related to empathy and personal characteristic. This knowledge covers 13 emotions, gender, Big Five personality traits, 19 dialogue acts and other knowledge. The table below shows a comparison of CPED with some other common conversation data sets.
